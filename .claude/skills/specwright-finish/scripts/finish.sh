#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Decisions for finishing a change that were prose before: how to undo an archive of a DEFERRED change. The script only READS
# the repo (rev-parse, status, log, show, diff-tree, ls-tree, ls-files, cat-file). It never checks out, moves, restores or
# commits; the user runs the scripts it prints. Every run prints ONE JSON document.
#
# Usage: bash finish.sh [--dir <planning toplevel>] undo-archive-plan --change <name> --archived-name <archived>
#                       --prefix <P> --main <main> [--branch <branch>] [--type <commit type>]
#   undo-archive-plan   the plan to undo the archive of <name> (its directory <P>/changes/archive/<archived>/) and of every
#                       change archived with it. <P> is the openspec root inside the planning repo ("openspec"). --dir is the
#                       planning repo (default: the current directory; store-backed: the store's toplevel). --branch is the
#                       branch that holds a committed archive (default: the current branch). --type is the commit type of the
#                       undo commit's subject `<type>(<name>): undo archive of <member names>`; default: the branch prefix
#                       (`bugfix` -> `fix`, any other prefix as it is, no prefix -> `chore`).
#                       Uncommitted archive (the archive directory is in the working tree and not in HEAD): the members are
#                       every untracked directory under <P>/changes/archive/ whose <P>/changes/<name>/ is tracked at HEAD and
#                       missing from the working tree. Committed archive: A is the NEWEST commit in <main>..<branch> that added
#                       the archive directory's review.md; the members are the archive directories A added. A member's name
#                       is its directory name without the date, unless the change was itself named with a date (that
#                       <P>/changes/<dated name>/ is the one the archive moved). Main specs include nested capabilities
#                       (<P>/specs/<area>/<id>/spec.md).
#                       JSON: ok, mode (uncommitted|committed), archive_commit (A, null when uncommitted), branch, head,
#                       members [{name, archived_name, deferred}], main_specs {modified[], created[]} (a spec deleted on the
#                       branch after the archive is left deleted, with a warning), amended[] (main specs whose working copy
#                       differs from A's synced content), carried_edits[] (archive-copy files with edits
#                       that are not committed or differ from the change directory), backup_dir
#                       (<git-dir>/specwright-undo/<archived>/), script, after_rerun (for a bulk archive, a script that
#                       archives the non-deferred members again and merges back amendments to the main specs they sync;
#                       null otherwise), warnings[].
#                       `script` and `after_rerun` are bash texts that begin with `set -euo pipefail`: save each to a file and
#                       run it with `bash <file>`. `script` guards the branch, HEAD and index first (a resume from another
#                       branch checks the tree is clean and the branch tip is the planned head BEFORE the checkout, then
#                       guards again), saves backups, builds ONE undo commit in the index (committed mode only), and fixes
#                       the working tree. Nothing here ever resets, force-pushes or reverts a later commit.
#                       Refusals (exit 1, ok false, error, message): no_archive (nothing to undo; `commits` lists the add
#                       commits when the newest add was reverted), dirty_tree (a resume on another branch with a dirty tree,
#                       or a synced main spec or member archive directory deleted from the working tree; `files` names
#                       them), staged_changes, target_exists (<P>/changes/<name>/ already exists), duplicate_member (two
#                       archive directories restore to one <P>/changes/<name>/), member_missing (a later commit deleted a
#                       member's archive directory; `paths` names them), backup_exists (the backup directory exists),
#                       bad_ref, not_a_repo.
# Exit: 0 done, 1 stop (the JSON has "ok": false, "error" and "message"), 2 usage.
