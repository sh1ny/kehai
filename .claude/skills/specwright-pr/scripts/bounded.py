"""Run one command under a deadline and a byte bound on its stdout and its stderr. Stdlib only, Python 3.8+.

The pr scripts run every network command (gh, git fetch/push/ls-remote) through here, so a stuck network or a huge
response ends as a named limit instead of a hang or an out-of-memory.

Limits (defaults live here only; the environment can lower them, for tests, but never raise them):
  120 s            per command                         SPECWRIGHT_NET_DEADLINE
  300 s            per paginated read (paged=True)     SPECWRIGHT_NET_PAGED_DEADLINE
  32 MiB           of stdout, and of stderr, per command  SPECWRIGHT_NET_MAX_BYTES
  50 pages         in a cursor loop a script drives    MAX_PAGES (constant)
  SPECWRIGHT_NET_DEADLINE_AT (epoch seconds) caps each deadline to the time left until then.
Test overrides (read from the run's environment, only when set; never needed in production):
  SPECWRIGHT_TEST_POLL     the wait interval of the loop, in seconds (default POLL)
  SPECWRIGHT_TEST_NO_JOB   1 makes the Windows job object fail, to test the fallback (read only by spawn)

Use as a library:  run_bounded(cmd, deadline, max_bytes, env, cwd, paged=False, secret=False) -> Result(rc, stdout, stderr, limit)
  limit is None, "deadline_exceeded" or "response_too_large" (rc is None then); deadline and max_bytes default (None) to the
  values above. stdout and stderr are text (UTF-8, undecodable bytes replaced).
Use as a CLI:      python bounded.py [--paged] [--secret] -- cmd...
                   python bounded.py --deadline-at   (prints time.time() + the deadline resolve() gives, for a caller's poll)
  Copies the command's stdout and stderr through after it ends and exits with its status. On a limit it prints
  `bounded: <limit>: <cmd[0]> <cmd[1]>` on stderr
  (for `sh -c script name args...`, the wrapped command: `name args[0]`) and exits 124 (deadline) or 125 (too large).

Windows argument transport: a native command line cuts an argument with spaces at 8186 characters when bash.exe parses it, so
for `bash -c script $0 args...` the arguments after $0 are not put on the command line. They go to the child's stdin as UTF-8,
each followed by a NUL, then an end marker; a prelude in front of the script reads them back into "$@" and empties stdin. Nothing
reaches disk. A missing marker (a runner that died mid-write, a bash older than 4.4) exits 126 without running the script.

Output is read from pipes as the command writes it and kept in memory, never on disk: a stream stops being read once it passes
the byte bound, so neither memory nor disk can grow past it between two checks, and the tree is stopped at once. Secret mode
(--secret, secret=True), for commands that print a credential, runs the same way. After a limit a survivor holding a pipe is
let go after 5 s. A command that exits while a process it started still holds a pipe gets 2 s for its readers, then that
tree is stopped and the command's own status and output are returned. The process tree is stopped by PID only, never by name.

Process interface for callers with their own capture loop (review-run.sh, release.sh), all stdlib, all public:
  spawn(cmd, data=None, hook_env=None, **popen_kw) -> Popen   starts the command in its own process group (POSIX: new session;
      Windows: suspended, assigned to a job object, then resumed, so nothing it starts escapes). The job handle is p.job (None
      when there is none); stdin is DEVNULL, or the bytes in `data` written by a daemon thread. Raises OSError when the command
      cannot start. On Windows without a job object it writes `bounded: no job object: <reason>` to stderr and goes on without.
  kill(p)             stops every process the command started, also when the command itself has already exited. Windows:
      TerminateJobObject, or `taskkill /T /F /PID` for a run without a job; POSIX: killpg. By PID or job only, never by name.
  close_job(p)        closes the job handle (the job has no kill-on-close: a finished command's detached helpers live on).
  watch_exit(p, wake) -> ExitWatcher   a daemon thread blocked in p.wait(); on exit it records time.monotonic() and sets the
      `wake` event the caller passes in. watcher.exit_time() is that time, or None while the command runs (it polls p.poll()
      if the thread could not start); watcher.wait(timeout) waits for the exit.
