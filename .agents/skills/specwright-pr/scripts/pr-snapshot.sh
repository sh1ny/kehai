#!/usr/bin/env bash
# One-call PR snapshot: state, checks, unresolved threads, unhandled comments
# and reviews, as one JSON line. Needs gh (uses gh's built-in --jq) and Python 3.8+:
# bounded.py gives every gh call a deadline and a size bound, so a hung call ends as
# `deadline_exceeded` on stderr (exit 1 in a watch); without Python, exit 2 `no_python`.
#
# Usage: bash pr-snapshot.sh [PR-number|PR-url] [--repo owner/name] [--logs]
#                            [--reviewer LOGIN:ROLE:SECONDS]...
#                            [--wait [--timeout SECONDS] [--interval SECONDS] [--until attention]]
#        bash pr-snapshot.sh --full NODE_ID [--repo owner/name]
#   (no PR)   the PR for the current branch
#   --reviewer  report whether LOGIN (required|advisory, timeout in seconds)
#             has reported on the current head: "reviewers" in the output
#   --logs    append the last 80 lines of each failing run's failed-step log
#   --full    read one item whole: the NODE_ID of a thread comment, PR comment or review
#             (the snapshot's "id"). Prints {"ok":true,"id","kind","body","rev","url"}
#             with the raw body; kind is thread_comment | comment | review; rev is the
#             item's own revision (lastEditedAt, else createdAt/submittedAt), never what
#             pr-reply.sh --rev takes. An unknown id prints {"ok":false,"error":"not_found"}
#             and exits 1; exits 3 when GitHub cannot be read. One call; no snapshot, no
#             --reviewer, no watch claim. Read every item with "clipped":true this way.
#   --wait    poll inside this process; print {"wake":..., "snapshot":...}
#             once anything changes (checks, threads, comments, reviews, head,
#             state, edits, a list getting cut off) or the timeout passes
#             (default 1800s, interval 300s) - elapsed time from the start, polls
#             included, and never slept past; "waited" is the elapsed seconds. Each
#             poll, the first snapshot included, has one 120 s deadline for all its gh
#             calls (SPECWRIGHT_NET_DEADLINE, a non-negative number of seconds, lowers it), so the timeout is reported
#             within ~130 s of passing. "incomplete" at once if the first good
#             snapshot is already cut off; exits 1 if the last poll failed (a failed
#             first snapshot has no base: the first good poll becomes it).
#             One watcher per PR on this machine: a newer --wait on the same
#             PR (from any agent; owner/name compared case-insensitively) takes
#             over, and the older one exits 4 before its next poll, so a lost
#             or forgotten watcher stops spending the account's API budget. A
#             watcher's exit never ends a newer watcher's ownership. If the
#             state directory cannot be created, it polls unowned and says so
#             on stderr.
#   --until attention  (with --wait only; "quiet" or any other mode exits 2 before any gh
#             call) keep waiting while a poll differs from the first good snapshot only
#             in checks or merge state, a check is still pending, no check fails that
#             was not failing in that snapshot, and the merge state is not DIRTY. Any
#             other difference wakes "changed". Skipped polls add no polls and no gh
#             calls; the wake JSON counts them as "filtered" (always present with
#             --wait, 0 without --until). A "timeout" wake still means nothing else
#             changed, filtered polls included. The snapshot's "attn" is "sig" without
#             the checks and merge state; "fail_names" are the failing checks' names,
#             base64 each.
# "head_cutoff": {source, at} says where reports start to count and each
# reviewer's timeout starts: source push | first_seen | first_seen_unsaved (the
# push is not in the activity log; see prepare_cfg).
# "clipped": true on a thread comment, PR comment or review means its body was cut
# at 2500 (thread comments) or 1200 (the others) characters; stripping HTML comments
# alone does not count.
# "complete": false means a list was cut off at its page size - do not treat
# missing items as absent.
# Wrap with as.sh to pin the GitHub identity.

# cfg for the reviewer check: the head's push time from the repository's
# activity log (cached per head) and GitHub's clock from a Date header, so
# timeouts never depend on the local clock. If the push is not in the log, the
# cutoff and the timeout start are the earliest GitHub time any snapshot on this
# machine saw the head, kept in <state>/heads/<owner>/<name>/<pr>/<oid>: never
# earlier than the push, so a timeout can come late but never early, and a
# report made before the head was first seen is not counted (never the commit
# date, which can precede the push by hours and so admits reports of a
# previous head). The record is written to a temp file and published with a
# no-clobber hard link, so the first writer wins and nobody sees an empty
# record; publishing it removes the records of the PR's other heads. If it can
# be neither published nor read (or does not parse), this process's own first
# sighting is used and kept across polls ("first_seen_unsaved").
